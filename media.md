### Bio
After a decade leading software engineering teams at venture-funded startups, Karl started down the path of entrepreneurship. He founded [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/) in 2020 and within two years, the company reached $2.5 million in annual revenue.

After removing himself from the day-to-day, Karl partnered with long-time friend, Manuel Weiss to purchase another digital service business, [The Podcast Consultant](https://thepodcastconsultant.com/) ([read more about the acquisition here](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/acquiring-tpc)). They're currently focused on implementing an organic growth strategy and streamlining operations at the 24-person podcast production business.

In his free time, Karl likes to write about his journey [buying and scaling digital service businesses](https://www.karllhughes.com/), run races, and spend time with his family in downtown Chicago.
