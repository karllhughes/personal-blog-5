I'm currently working with my partner, [Manuel Weiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelweiss1986/), to buy and build a collection of niche service businesses. Our 10-year vision (December 2033) is to amass a portfolio of 10+ companies with $100mm in total revenue.

Here's a summary of where we're at in our journey:

### [The Podcast Consultant](https://thepodcastconsultant.com/)
<p class="post-meta">2023</p>

<p class="hug">
The Podcast Consultant specializes in podcast editing and production services for financial and business podcasts. With over a dozen audio editors and producers on the team and 80+ shows, we've been able to work with some of the most well-known brands and professionals in the space.
</p>

We acquiried The Podcast Consultant in 2023, and are aiming to grow revenue by 50% in the first year.

### [This is Good Marketing](https://thisisgoodmarketing.com/)
<p class="post-meta">2022</p>

<p class="hug">
In 2022, Manuel and I paired up to create a course summarizing the best practices in modern content marketing. This is Good Marketing is a hub for that collected knowledge and offers both free and paid resources.
</p>

### [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/)
<p class="post-meta">2020</p>

<p class="hug">
Writing for a technical audience is notoriously hard and incredibly valuable. I founded
Draft.dev in 2020 to help developer tools companies create more content designed to reach software engineers.
</p>

Draft.dev topped $2.5mm in revenue in 2022, and thanks to our world-class team of engineers, editors, and writers, it's become a leader in the field of developer marketing.
