People often ask me what tools I use for various tasks, so I put together this list to make it easier to share.

I don't add tools here unless I personally use them and endorse them. Some of the links below are referral links 
which may give both of us a little free credit, so click away if you want to try any of these out. 

## Organization
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr) - Content calendar, personal CRM, applicant tracking system, and so much more.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) - My project management and life organization tool.
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) - I automate everything I can with Zapier.
- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) - I never knew I needed Calendly until I started a business. Cuts down on so many back-and-forths.
- [GSuite](https://refergsuite.app.goo.gl/ACiV) - Maybe too obvious, but half my life is in the Google Suite.
- [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) - I've tried several tools for time tracking, but Toggl is my favorite. The weekly reports help me see which areas of my business I'm spending time on and help me direct my priorities for the week ahead.
- [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/) - I bookmark things all the time and Chrome's bookmarks just don't do enough for organizing them. Diigo gives my bookmarks an RSS feed so I can dump them straight into my email newsletter. 

## Writing
- [Google Docs](https://refergsuite.app.goo.gl/ACiV) - After trying a few methods, I found the editing and commenting features in Google Docs in addition to the Grammarly integration to make it the easiest tool for writing. If only it supported Markdown rendering.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) - Takes care of all the little details when you're writing.

## Programming
- [Jet Brains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/) - The first IDE I've had that was worth every penny.
- [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/888fefc32a01) - The best all-around virtual machines available.
- [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) - Before you're ready for DigitalOcean, you probably want Heroku.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - For even smaller scripts and JavaScript projects, there's Vercel.
- [Github](http://github.com/) - Not only a code-hosting platform, Github is my go-to static site hosting as well.

## Sales and Marketing
- [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) - The best one-page landing page builder I've found.
- [Streak CRM](https://www.streak.com/) - Good for tracking sales leads, sending follow-ups, and mail merges.
- [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) - There are a million reasons you might want to find an email address. This is how I do it.
- [Mailchimp](http://eepurl.com/cMDrn5) - Has its rough edges, but Mailchimp is probably the best all-purpose email management tool available.
- [Goodbits.io](http://goodbits.io/) - I used to have a custom-built system for building my weekly email newsletters, but it got unwieldy after a while. Goodbits is the best solution I've found.  

## Misc
- [Wohven](http://wohven.refr.cc/karlhughes) - I wear a black t-shirt and jeans every day. Wohven takes care of my t-shirts.
