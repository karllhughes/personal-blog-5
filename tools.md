People often ask me what tools I use for various tasks, so I put together this list to make it easier to share.

I don't add tools here unless I personally use them and endorse them. Some of the links below are referral links 
which may give both of us a little free credit, so click away if you want to try any of these out. 

## Organization
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr) - Content calendar, personal CRM, applicant tracking system, and so much more.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) - My project management and life organization tool.
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) - I automate everything I can with Zapier.
- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) - I never knew I needed Calendly until I started a business. Cuts down on so many back-and-forths.
- [GSuite](https://refergsuite.app.goo.gl/ACiV) - Maybe too obvious, but half my life is in the Google Suite.

## Writing
- [Dropbox Paper](https://db.tt/qZOUEOyKDm) - I write all my blog posts in Dropbox Paper then export them as Markdown files.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) - Takes care of all the little details when you're writing.

## Programming
- [Jet Brains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/) - The first IDE I've had that was worth every penny.
- [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/888fefc32a01) - The best all-around virtual machines available.
- [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) - Before you're ready for DigitalOcean, you probably want Heroku.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - For even smaller scripts and JavaScript projects, there's Vercel.
- [Github](http://github.com/) - Not only a code-hosting platform, Github is my go-to static site hosting as well.

## Sales and Marketing
- [Streak CRM](https://www.streak.com/) - Good for tracking sales leads, sending follow-ups, and mail merges.
- [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) - There are a million reasons you might want to find an email address. This is how I do it.
- [Mailchimp](http://eepurl.com/cMDrn5) - Has its rough edges, but Mailchimp is probably the best all-purpose email management tool available.

## Misc
- [Wohven](http://wohven.refr.cc/karlhughes) - I wear a black t-shirt and jeans every day. Wohven takes care of my t-shirts.
