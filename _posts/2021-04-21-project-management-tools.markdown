How do you manage your project workflows?

Effective project management is crucial to the success of every startup. With limited resources, it's much cheaper to invest in great tools than more bodies. Because of this, founders and employees will [have to wear many hats](/posts/working-at-startup) and have to juggle a lot of competing priorities.

I've always relied heavily on great project management tools like the ones in this guide. We relied on them [for my previous startup's product management process](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/product-management-process), and having great tools is part of the reason I've been able [to grow my service business to 50 team members in just 7 months](/posts/scaling-services).

## How to Choose a Startup Project Management Tool

The problem is that there’s a huge array of project management tools on the market, and they vary greatly in terms of price and capabilities. Since every organization is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to project management tools.

To make sure you get the most effective tool for your team, you need to start with an honest assessment of your team’s capabilities and needs. If you’re already using a project management tool, ask yourself: **what does it lack? How does it complicate your workflow? What do you need in a new solution?**

It helps to take a step back and think about the organization’s pain points. **Are you struggling to communicate with other teams? Is the workload between team members spread unevenly?**

List all of the pain points of your organization, then mark each one with a priority level—high, medium, or low. Once you’ve made an outline, begin your search.

Using your outline as a guide, make a list of the tools that fit your needs. Depending on the size of your business, you might be able to use the tools for free. If a trial isn’t offered upfront, you can ask the vendors for a free demo for a limited time.

The most important part of this process is the trial. You need to test the features and capabilities to determine if it can fully meet your needs. These trials need to be quick because you can't spend years looking for the perfect tool, but they should help you decide if the tool is good enough for your use case or not.
