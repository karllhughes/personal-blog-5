Since June, I've applied to speak at a number of tech and developer conferences across the world. It's been fun to refine my proposals and I got accepted to speak at three already (I'll be posting about each, just check out the [Speaking](https://www.karllhughes.com/types/speaking) section of my site).

Anyway, one of the biggest challenges has been keeping up with which conferences happen when, where, and when proposals are due. In order to keep track of it all, I've created a table in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr) that [you can view](https://airtable.com/shry5mX0LQOFa0rnw), and a [free notification service that will tell you when CFPs are due soon](https://www.cfpland.com/).

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr) is one of my new favorite tools. It allows you to create visual databases as easily as a spreadsheet.

If you have your own conferences to add to my list, feel free to [submit your conference here](https://www.cfpland.com/#submit).
