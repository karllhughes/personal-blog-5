In 2017, I [started applying to speak at a number of tech and developer conferences across the world](/posts/one-year-conference-summary). It's been fun to refine my proposals, meet other speakers, and get accepted to speak at a few of them.

While I feel my experiences speaking have been pretty successful overall, one of the biggest challenges has been keeping up with which conferences happen when, where, and when proposals are due. In order to keep track of it all, I've created a [free email newsletter for other conference speakers](https://www.cfpland.com/).

CFP Land aggregates conferences from several sources around the web as well as some hand-curated and user submitted ones. These conferences cover a wide range of topics and are all over the world, so if you're thinking about speaking, I'd recommend [signing up](https://www.cfpland.com/).

If you want to help other speakers out by adding another conference or even to add to the list, feel free to [submit your conference here](https://www.cfpland.com/).
