While I haven't been writing here in the past month, I've been working on a few guest posts that all happened to go live last week. Here are some quick summaries with links to the original posts:

### Developing Self-Awareness

In college I made milkshakes at Chick-fil-A, delivered catering orders for a sandwich shop, tested washing machines at GE, pitched at business plan competitions, ran a couple of half-marathons, helped lead an engineering fraternity, and taught myself to make websites. It took me six and a half years to finish my undergraduate degree but, by the time I got out, I had tried enough things so that I knew what I did and didn’t want in my career. Developing a high level of self-awareness will prevent you from wasting time in a job that you'll hate, and it makes you a much more effective leader and team member. **[Read the rest on Startup Institute's blog](http://blog.startupinstitute.com/2016-07-07-developing-self-awareness/).**

### Figuring Out Engineering Culture During Interviews

Engineering culture is defined as, "the way we _build_ things around here." As a job seeker, the difference between working at a company with a strong emphasis on engineering culture and one without is stark. While you probably won’t be 100% sure what it’s like to work somewhere until you’ve been there for a week or two, there are plenty of great questions you can ask your potential future employers to suss out any red flags. **[Read the rest on The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-interview-questions-engineers-must-ask-to-figure-out-what-a-companys-cultures-really-like).**

### Dashboards for Agile Teams

We're big on tracking metrics at Packback, so when I started up a Twitter conversation with [Ali Pourshahid](https://twitter.com/ali_pourshahid), the Head of Engineering at Klipfolio, it made sense to collaborate on an article. This post expands on one I wrote [earlier for this blog](https://www.karllhughes.com/2016/sprint-tracking/), and it goes into some of the specific tracking metrics that both Klipfolio's engineering team and ours at Packback use to help keep tabs on how things are going throughout our sprints. **[Read the rest on Klipfolio's Blog](https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/how-dashboards-help-agile-software-development-teams).** ![](https://i.imgur.com/AGZW0YK.jpg) _This is a random photo I took in Arizona earlier this year.
