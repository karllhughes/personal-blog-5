*Back in March of 2012 when I wrote this article, I had been reading [Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People"](http://amzn.to/2kJSw6t) which definitely shows up in the tone of this post. That said, I agree with my past self that attitude is probably the biggest defining factor in framing success. I've grown a bit more realistic (read cynical) now, but I do still think that persistence and positivity will take you further than formal schooling or financial backing.*

> A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him. - [David Brinkley](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/topics/topic_success.html#ixzz1pNUVcQbp)

I'm amazed by people.  Every day, I hear someone tell me, "I wish I could do X..." or "If I had Y, I'd be happy."  Everyone wants to be happy, right? Everyone wants to be a _success_, although we all define it differently. What causes some people to _actually succeed_, and others to live like drones - floating through life until retirement and dying with a million, "I wish"es on their tounge? 

## A successful attitude

I've gotten to meet hundreds of successful entrepreneurs, inventors, publishers, and businessmen over the years.  The more I talk with those people, the more I love spending time with them.  The difference between _successful_ people is in their attitude, and when you meet someone with the attitude of success, _you are infected_. 

#### Elements to a successful attitude

*   Persistence
*   Positivity
*   Passion
*   Organization
*   Self-reliance

There are very few people who embody all these requirements, hence there are a limited number of successful people in the world.  While all these above traits are important, I have one master saying that trumps and encompasses all of them:

## "Never make excuses"

That is _literally_ the only thing you have to do in order to be successful. [Everyone has a dream](http://www.globotreks.com/features/19-reasons-ignore-everybody-follow-your-dreams/). For example, one of my friends wants to be an artist. Her parents wanted her to go to college so they paid thousands of dollars for her to get a psychology degree. Now, instead of chasing her passion in art, she works a middle management job at a retail outlet. When I asked her why she never pursued art - her dream - she said, "it's just too hard, plus I'd have to get another degree..." 

She will _never_ be successful.  She has already given in - at 20-something years old - to the pattern of making excuses. She will _never_ chase her dreams, she will _never_ change the world, and she _will_ always have a nagging feeling of failure in the back of her mind.

While this description sounds bleak, _millions_ or maybe _billions_ of people float through life like this young woman. Everyone has a dream; only [3% of people actually chase theirs](http://www.successvibe.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-228.html).

## What Do You Want to Be?

I'll leave you with this final question: _What do you want to be? Successful? Or Average?_
