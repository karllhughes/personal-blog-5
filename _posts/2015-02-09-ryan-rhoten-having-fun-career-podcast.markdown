Back in December [Ryan Rhoten](http://www.ryanrhoten.com/) got in touch with me about being a guest on his podcast. Ryan's show features business professionals who offer advice, tell stories, and answer Ryan's questions. It's a very well done show, so it was an honor to be included. On the show, Ryan and I talked about Packback, hiring - especially when it comes to startups, and my advice for having fun in your career. You're going to spend a lot of your life working, so you better love it. Let me know what you think of the episode!
