This year I was invited to speak at [Codemash](http://www.codemash.org/), a huge, multi-disciplinary event for software engineers, project managers, web developers, and others in the industry. I gave my talk on Testing Layers in Distributed Architectures, but unlike [the 25-minute version I gave at AP Strat & Practice](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-strat-2017-presentation), this version was a full hour long.

While the weather deteriorated on Friday (and my session was in the last time slot), I had a large, highly participatory audience who gave me some great feedback during the session. I didn't get to screencap or record this session (my own fault, I just forgot to turn on Quicktime), but [the slides are available on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B1Y5Uwi9TcETEsGM2691Sqw41n1J9PDvYRxaUUfirYs). I'm really glad that so many people in software development are interested in testing, and I can't wait to give the talk again at [U of I's Webcon in April](http://webcon.illinois.edu/).
