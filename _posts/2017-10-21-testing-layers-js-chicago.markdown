Last week I was able to give a short 20-minute version of my talk on Testing Layers in Distributed Systems that I'm going to be giving at a couple conferences in the upcoming year. Unfortunately, the audio is a little quiet, but it gives you a little bit of an idea what to expect.

Thanks to the [JS Chicago Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/js-chi/) organizers and members for letting me give this talk. If you're into Javascript and in the Chicago area, you should definitely [check this meetup out](https://www.meetup.com/js-chi/).
