Move over Wordpress and Wix; there's another no-code programming platform in the mix. [Bubble](http://bubble.io/) — a drag and drop application — allows people to build [web applications](/posts/web-applications) *without requiring them to learn how to code*.

In this article, you're going to learn what it costs, how to set up an account, and why you would use Bubble instead of hiring a developer. Let's start with the prices.

### Pricing Plan Structure

Bubble is a scalable service that offers [multiple price tiers](https://bubble.is/pricing). And here's the best part: The lowest tier is **free**! This is a great way to get a taste of the service without having to pay anything; however, features are limited with the free version. The free version is called the Hobby Plan.

The pricing plan structure is divided into two categories: individual use and company use. The free Hobby Plan and Personal Plan are included in the individual category. Here's a brief look at what they include:

- Hobby Plan: Free, core platform features, and "Built with Bubble!" branding
- Personal Plan: $14/month, white-label & custom domain, and real-time analytics

One of the main features of the company category is the ability to collaborate. Allowing multiple people to access the same application optimizes and streamlines production. Here's a brief look at the company plan options:

- Professional Plan: $62/month, 2 collaborators, and email support
- Team Plan: $165/month, 8 collaborators, and priority email support
- Production Plan: $445/month, 40 collaborators, and priority email support

It's beneficial to note that each company plan allows reserved server capacity whereas the individual plans only include basic server capacity.

It's also important to note that you don't pay anything until your app goes live.

### Why You Should Use Bubble

There are two primary reasons you should use Bubble: The platform will **save you time and money**. It takes months to learn how to code. Bubble cuts through the learning curve by utilizing drag and drop elements. The user will populate the canvas with these elements and ultimately define the workflows which make the application run.

[Let's read what customers are saying](https://bubble.is/showcase):

Adam Revetta, Founder of ScareHunt, writes, “I built my data-driven app on Bubble in a matter of weeks without writing a single line of code. I experiment with new features daily. Shorter feedback loops = better products.”

Using Bubble is less expensive than hiring a professional developer. It's not uncommon for the services of a good developer to cost thousands of dollars, depending on the complexity of the application.

### Setting up Your Bubble Account

Creating a Bubble account is easy. Navigate to the blue "Sign Up" box in the upper right-hand corner and create a login and password. Once you're in, you'll be offered to take short lessons which last between 5 and 10 minutes. These lessons include building a sign-up system, using conditions, and sending data to pages.

You'll start with Lesson 1: Saving Data. Opening the lesson will take you right to the heart of Bubble's application building area. The platform will guide you here and the rest is history. Once you have a baseline knowledge of creating an app, you can [install a pre-built template](https://bubble.is/templates) to kickstart your project.

If you'd like to share your finished app, [let me hear about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/karllhughes). I love seeing what people build using no-code tools.
