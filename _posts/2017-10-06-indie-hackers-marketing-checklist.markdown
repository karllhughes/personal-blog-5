I've been spending a little time every week promoting the [Side Project Marketing Checklist](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/) I wrote a few weeks ago - mostly by posting answers to questions on Quora, forums, and Slack channels. This week I decided to publish a longer post about the project on [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/).

Indie Hackers is one of my favorite blogs to hit my radar this year. The blog's founder, Courtland, interviews founders who have software products or small businesses that they self-funded. It's inspiring, but also extremely insightful and one of the biggest reasons I got around to creating the Side Project Marketing Checklist.

Check out the post linked below, and as always, [let me know what you think on Twitter](https://twitter.com/karllhughes).
