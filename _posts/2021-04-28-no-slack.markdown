Last year, I read two books that changed my perspective on work. The first was [Bored and Brilliant](https://amzn.to/3gpINPv) by Manoush Zomorodi. In it, Zomorodi explains the importance of not filling every moment of time with a _quick hit_ of something to do. Counterintuitively, doing nothing for periods of time can actually make you more productive in the long-run:

> “When our minds wander, we activate something called the 'default mode,' the mental place where we solve problems and generate our best ideas, and engage in what’s known as 'autobiographical planning,' which is how we make sense of our world and our lives and set future goals.” - Manoush Zomorodi, [Bored and Brilliant](https://amzn.to/3gpINPv)

The other life-changing book was Cal Newport's [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/3sIbWYy). In this book, Newport explains how the constant hopping between quick replies, notifications, and distractions makes creators less productive and happy. 

> “Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.” - Cal Newport, [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/3sIbWY)

I haven't gone quite as far as Newport recommends by completely shutting down my social profiles, but I did start removing notifications from them. I started to evaluate all the technology tools I used at work and thought a lot about whether they _actually_ made me more productive, or furthered the distractions so common in my ever-connected life.

One application that stood out as a prime target for elimination was Slack.

## Why I Don't Use Slack for Work
When I left my job to [start my own business last year](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer), I thought a lot about the kind of lifestyle I wanted to build. [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev) isn't a high-pressure, fast-growth startup; it's a business that I hope will give me time, location, and financial freedom. I don't have to make business decisions based on what venture capitalists, competitors, or someone else's "best practices."

As I decided [what I would maximize for](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/maximizing-for-energy), I realized that Slack was not a good fit for the kind of business (and lifestyle) I wanted to build.

Some good reasons here: https://newrepublic.com/article/160444/slack-salesforce-merger-office-communications

My reasons:

### The Availability Perception
I like talking to people, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to give people the impression that I'm available to chat any time throughout the day. Some days, I need to spend 6 hours in deep work, focusing on a hard problem or banging out an interesting idea for my blog. There's no such thing as a "quick question" when you're focused, and I want to build a business that gives me a lot of time for this kind of focus.

Now, I realize I can use "away" settings to show people that I'm not available, but I've never seen anyone respect or use them effectively in practice. When you have a team Slack, people assume that messages will be responded to within a few minutes and longer response times make people worry.

This problem might be as much a [human problem](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/slack-didn-t-break-remote-working-your-colleagues-did-4ce4f90b35) as a Slack problem, but I don't want to have to explain my preferred Slack etiquette to everyone who joins my team. It's ironic because Slack bills itself as a place to "get work done," but I've never seen it used for accomplishing anything significant.

### Slack Discourages Casual Use
Unlike Gmail, Slack pushes you heavily towards using their always on, notification-heavy desktop client. Sure, they have a web version, but it's limited and tries to push you into getting the desktop app at every turn.

I've tried tuning notifications for the desktop or mobile clients, but it's very hard to do without simply turning all notifications off, and once you get to the point, the question is, "Why not just use email?"

Spending time in "flow" every day is an important part of my re-energizing process, so having Slack constantly pinging or the little red dot showing up all day is just one more distraction from getting real work done.

### Feeling Held Hostage
- Things get lost, not a long-term holding place - no permanent record of decisions made
- Feeling held hostage by their business model - don't store important docs, notes, etc. here

## what's slack good for?
- socializing/networking - I use a couple channels like water coolers to chat with friends/mastermind, I've gotten clients from Slack groups
- businesses that require quick responses (although SMS, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. would all work for this too), but I think these are usually pretty limited. (When would a 1-hour response time honestly kill your business?)

## What I do instead
- Email for general communication - I check twice/day (4 hour workweek style), inbox 0, filters, stars, VA
    - “Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things.” - Tim Ferriss
- Comments on project management tools (Trello, Airtable) that go to email
- Calendly to schedule calls, rarely do "quick chats"
- Set up Slack notifications to go to email if I must use it
