In the days of [Web 1.0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-1-0-web-2-0-and-web-3-0-with-their-difference/), entrepreneurs had to learn code or hire web developers to create a website. Now, two decades later, startup founders are able to build [web applications](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/web-applications) without needing to know a single line of code.

There are numerous non-technical tools you can use to build web applications. I'm going to talk about ten of them, starting with Wordpress.

### 1. [Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/)

Wordpress is a no-code-required powerhouse; as a matter of fact, the content management platform is responsible for powering 32% of the web. Wordpress.org boasts a massive library of over 45,000 plugins which allows for the customization of a website.

### 2. [Bubble](http://bubble.io/)

Bubble features a drag and drop interface allowing for a web application to be molded like a sculpture. This web application builder is packed with connectivity integrations. For example, you're able to connect your own SQL database to the application build. Bubble has an active community online (forums) and in person (local meetups). 

### 3. [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)

If your startup is focused on selling products, Shopify is the perfect solution for you. This web application builder integrates your existing product information with Facebook Ads. Shopify is a great option for newer startup founders because the platform includes free, live coaching via the Shopify Academy.

### 4. [Knack](https://www.knack.com/)

### 5. [Sheet2Site](https://www.sheet2site.com/)

Google Sheets is an easy, powerful, and free online spreadsheet application. What if you could use the data in a Google Sheet to create a website? That's what Sheet2Site does. Here's the best part: It's free. There's also a premium option ($10/month) which includes a custom domain, chat, Google Analytics, and more.

### 6. [Zoho Creator](https://www.zoho.com/creator/)

Shoutem is a mobile app builder which allows you to import existing content from a website. This user-friendly platform features a drag and drop interface and analytics.

### Conclusion

These web app builders are great options for startup founders who have limited or no coding knowledge. I listed ten here; however, there are a lot more in the wild. Do you have a favorite that's not listed? If so, [tell me about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/karllhughes). I love hearing about new tools for low and no-code development.
