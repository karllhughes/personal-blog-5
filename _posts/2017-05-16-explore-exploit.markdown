We make "explore vs. exploit" decisions all the time in software engineering. For example, if you were asked to build a new web application would you use a framework you already knew or try something on the cutting edge? When refactoring some code, would you try to only use patterns already used in the library or would you explore new design patterns?

I can think of dozens of choices like this that Iâ€™ve made in the past few months, and while some are pretty minor, many have a huge impact on how long projects take and how easy or hard they are to maintain.
