I've been using [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) for over a decade, and it has continued to impress me with new features, improved design, and more flexibility every year. Coupled with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) for automation, there's not a lot you can't do with Google Forms.

That said, it's 2020 and there are plenty of alternatives to Google Forms that might work better for your startup. Depending on what you want to do, one of these Google Forms competitors might finally get you to change the way you collect surveys and user input.

## [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr)

While not exclusively a form creator, Airtable's input tool is pretty powerful, especially when combined with its database-like storage system. Airtable is easy to set up, data can be viewed in multiple ways, the sharing settings are flexible, and you [can use it to power your API](/posts/using-airtable-as-an-api).

## [Typeform](http://typeform.com/)

Typeform has a really unique and visually appealing style. Because they offer a comprehensive API, you can embedd Typeforms in websites to avoid writing lots of custom code.

## [Wufoo](https://www.wufoo.com/)

When I need more features or to accept payments, Wufoo is my go-to form builder. It costs a few bucks per month, but with that you can collect thousands of responses, connect with Stripe and other payment systems, and still get integrations with Zapier and other services.

## [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)

It's not quite as open-ended as Google Forms, but SurveyMonkey is decidedly better for capturing user, employee, or customer feedback and making sense of the results. Many of the features are similar to other form builders, and you can get started building surveys with up to 10 questions for free.

## [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)

It may seem like Formspree offers less than Google Forms, but its simplicity is also its power. You can drop a few lines of code from Formspree into your website and immediately start getting responses emailed to you for free. Best of all, the form can be fully customized (using code) to match your site's styling exactly.

## [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com/)

JotForm gives you hundreds of themes and templates to make sure your forms stand out and match your branding. Their paid plans also include HIPAA Compliance, so if you're in a healthcare setting, you may want to check out JotForm.

## [Formsite](https://www.formsite.com/)

Formsite rides the border between form builder and full-on web application creator. You can set up payments, complex data workflows, and embed the forms on your website or landing page.

## [CognitoForms](https://www.cognitoforms.com/)

Cognito's builder allows you to take payments for a percentage of sales rather than a monthly fee, so it could be great in situations where your revenue is uncertain.

## [Formstack](https://www.formstack.com/)

With a relatively high price point, Formstack definitely falls on the premium end of the alternatives to Google Forms. That said, you get what you pay for. They have a massive integration library, hundreds of templates, and lots of examples of forms built for different goals and industries.

## [Formidable Forms](https://formidableforms.com/)

If your site is built on Wordpress, check out the Formidable Forms plugin. They have both a free and paid level of support, so if you're not technical and need a little help integrating it, they can probably make it happen.

## [Appenate](https://www.appenate.com/)

If you've outgrown forms entirely and you need something a little more robust, check out Appenate. It's a no-code platform for building internal applications that can be accessed over the web.
