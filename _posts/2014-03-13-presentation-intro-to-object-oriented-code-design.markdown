On Friday, March 14th I'll be giving this presentation to the developers-in-training at [StartupInstitute](http://startupinstitute.com/) here in Chicago. In this presentation I'll be covering the basic terminology of object oriented programming, examples of how they work in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and a coding challenge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKQ6Ohj_PFY#t=162 The presentation slides are available here:
