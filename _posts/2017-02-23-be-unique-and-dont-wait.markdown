*This is another post I'm republishing as part of my [2017 daily writing project](/posts/2017-writing-goal). Like many of the others originally published in 2012, I was focused on inspiring people to action. Reading this almost five years later is inspiring, but also exciting, and I hope it helps some readers remember to take a few risks in life.*

So many young, aspiring professionals and entrepreneurs talk about how they _would_ do something unique, exciting, and world-changing if only...

Fill in the blank with whatever you want - money, time, knowledge - the point remains the same. Rather than take the first steps to pursue their dream, they sit and worry about why they think they can't do it...not yet at least. 

## Excuses be damned. Get started now!

> _This is your one opportunity to do something that no one has ever done before and that no one will copy throughout human existence. And if nothing else, you will be remembered as the one guy who ever did this. This one thing._ - Natalie Portman in Garden State

The above quote is one of my favorites from Zach Braff's _[Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/)_. The film goes through one young man's experience coping with the loss of his mother, meeting a new love, and finding something that he is _truly_ passionate about. Even if it's not your favorite movie, there is something to be taken from that quote. **Every moment you create is unique. You just have to appreciate it.**

People who are young and ambitious, think that the only way to change the world is to build the next Facebook, make headlines, and become super-rich.  Let's get real though; plenty of the world's greatest creators weren't even recognized within their natural lifetimes. _And even if you do get rich, you don't do it by waiting around for someone to help you out, do you?_ Of course not.

Every person who made something great happen, did it because he or she wanted to do it, not because someone else made it happen for them. So, my final encouragement to my fellow young, aspiring entrepreneurs is this: **Go. Just Go. Do Things. Make Things Happen. Stop Making Excuses.**

Even if your first stab at changing the world is a total miss, you'll be one stab ahead of everyone who was too scared to make it. No one will ever be able to give you a foolproof formula for success - and if they do, they're full of shit - but by making an attempt, you'll find yourself quickly advancing ahead of those who were too scared to try. The truth is that if you attempt to change the world in your 20's and you fail, you have a lifetime to make up for it and remain financially solvent. If you wait until you're 40 and have children, you're risking 100x more than you are now.

So, don't delay. Make big things happen today.
