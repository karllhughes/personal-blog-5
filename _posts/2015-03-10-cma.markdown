On March 12th, I spoke at the [College Media Association's 2015 Conference in New York City](http://nyc15.net/). A couple years ago I spoke in New Orleans on the topics of Sponsored Content and Gamification in News, but this year as my role is now more technical, so was my topic. I gave a presentation on how websites work for non-techies. 

Here's a screencaptured version of the talk in case you couldn't make it:

## Summary:

Just about every profession has been effected by the internet, but very few people actually understand how it works. My goal in this presentation is to give non-technical people an overview that goes deep enough to stay interesting, but not so advanced that you can't keep up. We'll walk through the request cycle of loading a website using the analogy of sending a letter, show an example of how this request cycle works for a website like Facebook.com, and finally peel back the layers and look at some of the code that makes a website work. If you want to learn more about the topics presented here or you'd like to follow up with me, here are all the links you'll need.
