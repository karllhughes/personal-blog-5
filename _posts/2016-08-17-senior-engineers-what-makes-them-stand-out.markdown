I was recently asked by the editors at The Muse to contribute some thoughts on what makes a software engineer "senior" versus "junior" or "mid-level". This is really hard because it's a subjective and relative title. One thing that I do believe is that the title "senior engineer" has little to do with number of years of experience, but a lot to do with the quality of those years of experience. I ended up coming up with 7 characteristics of senior engineers: **1\. They Have Strong Debugging Skills** **2\. They Know When Not to Do Something** **3\. They Mentor Others** **4\. They Review Code Meticulously** **5\. They Can Communicate Complex Technical Ideas** **6\. They Specialize** **7\. They Admit What They Don’t Know** To read more including full explanations of the above list, [check out the article on The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/advice/7-traits-that-make-senior-engineers-stand-out-from-more-junior-team-members?ref=carousel-slide-0). ![](https://i.imgur.com/uElw8Ah.jpg) If you have additions to the list, feel free to [let me hear them on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/karllhughes).
