I hopped onto Facebook today to update it with one of the latest articles from [Uloop](https://www.facebook.com/uloop) and was greeted with a new feature.

## Would You Like to Promote This Post...for a Fee?
So in this case, Facebook will let me pay $10 to ensure that this post reaches approximately 3,300 people.  Our page generally reaches around 8,000 people per week, but occasionally we'll have a viral post that reaches up to 80,000. 

The weekly numbers aren't really fair though. Each individual post generally reaches 500 to 800 people, but like the weekly number, that can vary quite a bit as well. So, for $10 Facebook will put my post out to 5 or 6 times as many people as usual.

The only gripe I have with it is that it's easy to screw up and accidentally promote a post. When testing it out for this article, I clicked _Save_, but before making the post live, I hit cancel. Turns out the _Cancel_ didn't register. Oh well, it was only $10, and I guess this will be my test  I'll just know not to touch that button unless I'm sure that I want to promote a post.

What do you think?  Will you be using the promoted post feature to get your business' posts out to more fans?
