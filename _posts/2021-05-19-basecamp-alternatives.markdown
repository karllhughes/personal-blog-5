Basecamp has recently come under fire for [changes](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5) the founders implemented including the prohibition of societal and political discussions on the company’s internal Basecamp account. It also ceased giving out “paternalistic” benefits and has done away with committees.

This decision, particularly the prohibition of societal and political discussions, has prompted about [one-third of Basecamp’s employees](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1388212468510380034?s=20) to accept buyouts and leave the company. And it’s not only Basecamp’s employees who are affected by this decision, as many of their customers are looking to find alternatives to this otherwise well-respected project management platform.

## Selecting a Good Project Management Tool Alternative

Given the wealth of project management platforms on the market, it can be difficult to choose one that suits you and your team’s unique needs. To help you select the best one for your team, I’ve compiled a list of features that every good project management tool should have.

Prior to selecting a platform, you need to consider what exactly you need from a project management tool. It helps if you can consider your team’s size and identify your team’s existing pain points. From there, you can begin your search for tools with features that can address these issues.

The good thing about many of these tools is that they have a trial version that you can test for free to see if any of them could work for your team. After testing out your selected platforms, it’s important to gather feedback from your team to see how your selections fare and if they are able to address your pain points.

Features that I consider include:


*   Ease of use
*   Dashboard accessibility
*   Ease of collaboration
*   Software security
*   A pricing plan that works within your budget
*   Time tracking
*   Report integration and real-time reporting capabilities
*   External sharing capabilities
*   Customizable interface
*   The company's track record on diversity, inclusion, and social impact

## More Options

I had been considering a move to Basecamp this year before the latest debacle, but fortunately there are plenty of good alternative platforms that support diversity and fair employee benefits.

If you want an even wider selection of project management tools, I’ve also got a more [comprehensive list of available alternatives here](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/project-management-tools). With the COVID-19 pandemic greatly changing the way we work, it’s become even more important for teams to be able to collaborate and work on projects wherever they may be. These project management tools not only help startups and businesses streamline their workflows, but also boost productivity, improve project timelines, and help accomplish deadlines.
