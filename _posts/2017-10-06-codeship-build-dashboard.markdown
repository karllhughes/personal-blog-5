Last month I spent some time demoing the new [Codeship v2 API](https://apidocs.codeship.com/v2/introduction). My goal was to come up with a project to build using the API so that I could write a blog post about it. What I came up with was a public Codeship Builds dashboard.

The project is open source and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/karllhughes/build-status). It uses Node, Express, and Handlebars to display the results of my most recent Codeship builds, and I have it hosted at [builds.khughes.me](https://builds.khughes.me/).

For a complete tutorial, check out the blog post on Codeship linked below.
