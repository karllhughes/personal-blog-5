Recently, I was asked about writing an e-book, "You haven't published an e-book yet? Why not?"

Honestly, 90% of low-cost e-books I have read suck.  I'm not talking about books that are also backed by a publisher and published as an e-book and a regular book. I'm talking about the thousands of crappy bloggers out there who think that compiling their top posts into digital book form means they can charge $4.99.

Let me repeat: _compiling your blog posts does not give you the right to charge people money_. That's just deceiving your customers. Now, there are legitimate writers with great advice and experience who don't want to bother getting published by a company, so they publish independently in e-book form. Unfortunately these writers are rare.

Most of the e-book writers out there seem to be [attempting to make a quick buck](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/government-pressuring-publishers-to-adjust-pricing-policy-on-e-books/), and that just devalues the medium. 

#### Back to why I won't publish one anytime soon

I _love_ to write, but I also believe that _books should be meaningful_.  Now, it's not that I don't have anything meaningful to say - if I didn't, I wouldn't write at all.  But, I feel like a book should be a serious undertaking.  It should require my full attention.  It should add _meaningful value_ to my readers' lives. It's that simple. 

#### Let's Stop Over Publishing Junk

To all my fellow bloggers and writers: please take books seriously.  _Especially_ if you charge money for your work. I'll appreciate it greatly.
