We've been shifting focus at Packback over the past year - it's what you do at a startup after all. When I first joined, we were all about textbooks, and while I think we still have a huge opportunity to disrupt that market, I'm really excited about changing the way students interact with each other because real learning doesn't happen by memorizing lists in a textbook; real learning happens when students are able to ask intelligent and informed questions, have difficult discussions, and interact with their peers.

Here's a little more about what we've been working on at Packback and why it matters from my colleague Jessica Tenuta at TEDx in Normal, IL: https://youtu.be/SfhSrk2q-GA
