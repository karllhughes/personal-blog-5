I have not been writing as much this year as [I did in 2017](/posts/2017-writing-goal), but I do occasionally find 
time to put something together. This past month, I've had two pieces published in [PHP Architect Magazine](https://www.phparch.com/) and I made an appearance on their podcast, so I figured 
I would share and link them here.

## Cultivating a Community: Five Things I’ve Learned Running a PHP User Group

In my first year of co-organizing the [Chicago PHP User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-PHP-User-Group/), I have learned a lot and met many wonderful people. Combining insights from the community with some of my own, I wanted to pass on some of the things I’ve learned about building and maintaining a thriving technical community. Whether you’re an organizer or attendee, I hope this gives you some insight into what goes on behind the scenes of running a user group.

## Community Corner: On Diversity in Conference Speakers

Our systems truly evolve and change for the better when folks privileged by oppressive systems, who might reap some benefits from a destructive status quo, decide they would prefer a better, richer, more inclusive community, and take some of that labor on themselves.

Recently, members of our shared PHP community chose to do just that. Here, I reflect on that choice, how he and others came to make that decision in this specific situation, and why.

I'm especially grateful to [Oscar Merida](https://twitter.com/omerida) for reaching out specifically to republish this 
piece from [here on my blog](/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers). I think this is one of the most important 
issues in tech today, and a lot of people shy away from writing about it for fear of the blowback (plenty of which I felt).

## Running the Chicago PHP User Group (Podcast)

As a follow-up to my article about _Cultivating a Community_, Eric Van Johnson and John Congdon had me on the PHP Architect
podcast to talk about co-organizing the PHP User Group here in Chicago. It was a lot of fun because Eric and John
both help run a user group in San Diego, so I learned a lot about their experiences as well.
