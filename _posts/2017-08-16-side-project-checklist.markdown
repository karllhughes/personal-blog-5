Like many developers, I've been building side projects in my spare time for years. One of the most fun things about being a software developer is having the ability to build tools that solve your own problems, so most of these projects have been very specific to my needs, but a couple have had potential for market appeal.

The problem for me has always been [effectively marketing my side projects](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/2017/why/). Typically, I build a product for myself, try a few things to get the word out, and then lose interest. This has led to most of my projects languishing in obscurity, but this year I'm trying to change that.

## The Side Project Marketing Checklist

I like organizing things, and after reading [Atul Gawande's Checklist Manifesto](http://amzn.to/2fLymZ3) a couple years ago, I've been really into checklists. Since I wanted to get better at marketing my side projects, I figured the best thing to do would be to make a big checklist for them. [I put the checklist out on Github](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing), and soon after [I built a landing page](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/) and [posted in on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14942902).

In the first 24 hours, almost 31,000 people saw the list.

I was blown away. The repository has been [trending on Github](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/894619969316638720) for the past two weeks now, and it's been linked to and shared on hundreds of smaller sites as well. I quickly put up an email signup form and got a few hundred email subscribers. Hundreds of people shared it on other social networks as well.

## Creating the list

I spent about an afternoon compiling the first version of the list. After a couple re-works and reorganizations, I felt pretty good about it. Most of the tactics were things I had either tried or been told about by friends at startups. No project will use _every_ item on the list, but I wanted the list to be comprehensive. That way, when I started a new project, I could copy the list, remove the items that didn't apply to this project, and then I'd have a simple step-by-step guide for marketing the project.

Making the whole thing fit into a single page was important to me. Side projects aren't companies with dedicated marketing resources - they're just something you spend a few hours per week on - so I knew that spreading the list out across a bunch of pages wouldn't work.

I also knew that I wouldn't have space in the checklist to include tutorials for _how_ to do everything, so instead I linked out to other resources that other people have written on the topics.

Initially the list was just a markdown file, but after I had a good working version, I decided to use [Github Pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) to build a little landing page around it. I bought a domain name and put it all out there at [SideProjectChecklist.com](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/).

I also decided that there were two things I wanted users to do when they got to the site:

1. Star the repository on Github.
2. Sign up for my email list.

I made those two calls to action very prominent on the site without being annoying that way people would gravitate to one or both of those options.

## Promoting it

My plan from the start was to use the side project checklist to market the side project checklist. This was my first project where I used the checklist from the start ([here's how I use it](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/2017/how-to-use/)), and I'm actually surprised at how well it worked.

I had no idea that the checklist would resonate as strongly with people as it has, but I do think that a big part of its success was luck. Still, there were some things that made an outsized impact when I was promoting it:

1. I posted it on Reddit first. There are a lot of great subreddits for side projects and startups that appreciate this kind of post.
2. Next I shared it to some Slack groups I am in.
3. Once I had a few stars on Github and another contributor, I shared it to Hacker News. The crowd on Hacker News loves posts about side projects (that's where [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) built pretty much all of their followers) but the post hadn't picked up a ton of traction on Reddit earlier, so I wasn't sure.

As it started picking up steam and hit the front page of Hacker News, I started making a plan for following up on its success:

1. I made an email list and put two sign up forms on the checklist. A couple people said that was too much, but I thought it was better than adding a popup or one of those exit-intent things.
2. I started thanking people on Twitter who were sharing it. Twitter makes it easy to [search for tweets by URL](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sideprojectchecklist.com&src=typd).
3. I made a plan for weekly blog posts and a weekly email newsletter. While I knew the success from Hacker News wouldn't last forever, I wanted to capture and hold at least a little audience to help me improve the checklist over time.

## The future

While I still don't have a rock-solid plan for monetizing the checklist (I'm not sure it'll be worth it until it's a bit bigger), I do have a roadmap for marketing the project and getting more contributors.

The whole project is open source! So, if you have a suggestion to improve it or you'd like to learn more, check it out on [Github](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing) or [on the web](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/).
