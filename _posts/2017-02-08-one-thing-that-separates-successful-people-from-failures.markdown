Right now, I'm working on a series of posts for Uloop that [highlight startups on the East Coast](http://tennessee.uloop.com/news/index.php/1129-ecss). Over the past two weeks, I've gotten to meet with almost a dozen entrepreneurs, startup companies, filmmakers, and all-around successful people and it's amazing to hear that _all of them_ mention a single trait that separates successful students, employees, and entrepreneurs from those who are not: **Initiative.** 

## What is "initiative"?

The word can be phrased many different ways. Some call it _hustle_; some call it _drive_; some call it _people who just jump out there and do it_. Regardless of the verbiage, the principle is the same. **Successful People Don't Make Excuses. They _Try_ to Make Things Happen.**

The key here is that they _have to try_, not that they instantly succeed. Thomas Edison is a perfect example of this. The man tried hundreds (and maybe thousands) of materials in his light bulb before settling on something that worked. If he had spent years researching and learning instead of just getting out there and doing, do you think he would have succeeded?

> I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. - [Thomas Edison](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/t/thomas_a_edison.html)

Every entrepreneur I have talked to has experienced at least some failures, but that's not what defines them. You know why? Because they had the initiative to _keep trying_. Any dream worth pursuing is a dream worth _fighting for_.

## "But what if I'm not ready to try?"

Most people I talk to have a dream. Most people I talk to also fail to ever pursue it. They give themselves excuses like "when I get my next degree, I'll be ready," instead of _committing to it now_. They don't realize that if they simply _took the initiative_ and started pursuing their dream today, they _could_ make it happen. 

## "But taking initiative is _different_"

People who take initiative are rarely immediately rewarded.  When I started my first business, I spent countless hours building and learning things that never made me a dime. In fact, I lost over $2000 building a blog that never made $100 in advertising revenue. People thought it was cool that I was trying, but they didn't want to do it, "that sounds like _a lot_ of work...and you don't even make money?" was their response. They're right. In the short term, taking initiative seems stupid.  It takes work, it will stress you out, you will pass up opportunities, and you may even get laughed at. 

## Final challenge: do something different

I want all of my readers to find the joy that I have from _being different_.  I want to leave you with a small challenge: _do something different today_. Something that makes you uncomfortable, something that makes people laugh at you, something that opens you up to vulnerabilities. When you do, let me know about it.
