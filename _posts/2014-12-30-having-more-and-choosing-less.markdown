If you've been reading my blog for the past couple years, you know that one of my big personal projects is to cut down on excess.

This is hard to do in our pro-gadget, pro-consumerist society, but I think it's a worthwhile pursuit, and even just consciously thinking about it from time to time makes you grateful for what you already do have. Still, it's hard for me sometimes, especially around the holidays. There's a constant temptation to buy more, eat more, and spend more, and it's really difficult to escape when you're - as I was this Christmas - outside of my normal environment.

Still, slipping up and going overboard with a few too many cookies from time-to-time isn't the end of the world, and I find that my motivation to live with less is often highest after a big splurge. So, here's to 2015. It's a new year, a new start, and a new chance to do some things better than we did last year. I'm not big on resolutions, but I certainly have my share of new habits to kick off this year. I for one am excited about the second half of the decade, and would love to hear from you. 

## What do you want to get out of 2015?
