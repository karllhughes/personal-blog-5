The decade between adolescence and adulthood was a transformative one for me and the lessons I learned helped define my career path and what I do today. At the time, I was impatient and hungry for success that never seemed to come, but in hindsight, the foundations I set then were a big part of my success now.

I’m just a couple of years out of my 20s now and as an avid reader, there were a few books that made a big impact on my career and worldview. Here are some of the **best books to read in your 20s** that can help you discover your true self, advance your career, and live your 30s as a happier, more well-rounded person.

## Kickstarting Your Job Search

Job hunting when you’re fresh out of school can be daunting. With hardly any experience in both career and life, it can be easy to get lost in the rat race. These books can help you discover your unique talents and strengths, so you can unleash your full potential.

### [What Color Is Your Parachute?](https://amzn.to/3H6N6Kd)

One of the first books I’ve read in my 20s, this bestseller by Richard Nelson Bolles definitely deserves a spot on your reading list. It’s been in print for five decades, but that doesn’t make it outdated. Its annual revisions keep it relevant to the ever-changing business and economic landscape.

This book offers a great mix of timeless advice, perspectives on new trends, and the latest resources for job hunters. It veers from the traditional concepts of job hunting and presents a different approach that involves some introspection. The author also provides some relevant insights on passions and skills, which takes the book from a mere jobseeker’s guide to a manual for life.

This book will help you discover your skills and strengths through self-assessment. By the time you finish reading, you’d have a better idea of who you are and what you want to do with your life.

"This book is extremely comprehensive…[It] dares you to believe that your dream job really exists, and that you can really find it. And that alone makes it worth reading." - Geoff English

### [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://amzn.to/3klYfNP)

Gain deeper insights into the growth mindset from renowned psychologist Carol S. Dweck. This book is a fairly easy read with plenty of narratives on how the power of mindset made an impact on the lives of real people.

The concept is pretty straightforward—your mindset has a significant effect on your future. The ideas presented are universal and applicable to your career, relationships, business, and other aspects. Some parts tend to be repetitive, but they underscore the importance of changing a fixed mindset to one that enables you to adapt, grow, and achieve your full potential.

“This book was not quite as scholarly as I had anticipated, but instead, it was a highly readable yet credible explanation of how our thinking can create traps that limit our behaviours, feelings, and thoughts. It’s a great companion piece to the wealth of knowledge out there in personal development. Read it and grow.” - Michael MacDonald
