Last week, Packback was invited to pitch at the [Challenge Cup](http://challengecup.1776dc.com/) event hosted by 1776 and held at 1871. After the first round of one-minute pitches, we were invited back up to be one of two education startups to give our full pitch in five minutes.

Normally Mike and/or Kasey would have handled this, but due to some scheduling conflicts with investor meetings, I got asked to fill in. I haven't done much public speaking since I was pitching my startup flop back in college, but it went well, and we ultimately won the education category. In May, we'll be presenting again in the finals in DC, and will have a chance to meet with influential investors and politicians in the area.
