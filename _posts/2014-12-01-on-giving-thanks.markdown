It's way too easy to skate through life expecting certain things from other people and not mindfully giving thanks. I'm as guilty of it as anyone, and it's not just something we should be paying attention to around the holidays. It really should be a yearlong, daily thing. Expressing gratitude [can actually make you happier](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/harvard_mental_health_letter/2011/november/in-praise-of-gratitude). 

Rather than write more I'm just going to leaveÂ you with a song that makes me grateful for happiness, sadness, life, and death. Thank you, everybody!
