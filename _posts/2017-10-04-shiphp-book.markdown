Last month I finished my first book - a step-by-step guide for PHP developers who want to learn Docker called "Building PHP Applications in Docker". It's about 10,000 words (40 pages), and it covers quite a bit if you're new to Docker.

Download the book for free at [www.shiphp.com](https://www.shiphp.com/).

The goal of the project is to use the free book, blog posts, and open source software to market courses and training programs that will be paid. I'm still working on the course (or courses), but this strategy will allow me to reach a critical mass of users _before_ I invest a ton of time in the course or training programs.

In the meantime, I'm definitely interested in feedback. If you're a PHP developer who's interested in Docker, please let me know what you'd like to see in future blog posts or courses by [reaching out on Twitter](twitter.com/karllhughes).
