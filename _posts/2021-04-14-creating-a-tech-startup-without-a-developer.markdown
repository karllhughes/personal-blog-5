There's a perception out there that creating a successful software startup is about nothing more than making a product that by its awesome and paradigm-shifting nature will magically attract customers.

Consider the following conversation I had recently:

**Would Be Founder:** "I want to make an app that suggests outfits for you based on the weather, your personal style, and the season."

**Me:** "Sounds awesome! What can I do to help?"

**WBF:** "You wanna build it for me?"

**Me:** "I'm pretty committed to other projects right now. Why not start by sending a daily email to a few select cities manually? That way you can validate that people will sign up for something like this. Then, once you've got some validation, let's talk through the product."

**WBF:** "What? You mean do it...manually? That sounds really annoying."

**Me:** "..."

My point here is that if you aren't willing to do the work, you shouldn't be starting a business.

Even if [your technology will eventually be a differentiator](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/high-tech-enabled), you need to figure out what people really want. You can't start with a product, or you're sure to build something that either (1) nobody wants, (2) nobody will pay for, or (3) isn't very good.

In this guide, I'm going to share the step-by-step process you can take for building a lean software startup. While inspired by books like _[The Lean Startup](http://amzn.to/1B0iIrv)_ and _[The Startup Owner's Manual](http://amzn.to/1IEefBk)_, I'll inject a lot of my personal experience and some modern tooling to help you launch faster.

I'll also give you a preview of what comes after launch (assuming it all goes well), and how you can start to make your first hires and raise your first funding. This is going to be a long one, but hopefully, it helps you see the road before you as you start your first software startup.

_Note: If you want more great books for startup founders, check out [my list of recommendations here](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books)._

## Coming Up With the Idea
**TL;DR: People put way too much stock in ideation. Just start _doing_ something.**

Action beats ideas, but you do need something to take action on. I've seen [three reasons that founders pursue a particular startup idea](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1334521133610258434): 

### 1. They Find a Problem That Needs Solving
A lot of founders see a problem in their daily lives or day jobs that leads them to start a software company. Personal experience with a problem is good because you're the target market, but you have to make sure other people actually care enough to pay for a solution.

AirBnb fits in this category. The founders made it socially acceptable to solve the problem of accommodations by letting people rent out their homes. There was very little market for this sort of thing before they normalized it.
 
### 2. They See Validated Market Demand
Startups founded based on clear market demand (i.e., people already pay money to solve this problem) will have the easiest time getting started. Not only are customers searching for solutions, they're likely already paying someone to solve the problem. You just have to prove you're better.

That said, it's harder to defend startups based on existing market demand. You're not the only option for solving this problem, and existing competitors will have more resources and existing revenue to fend you off with.

An example of a market-first startup is Uber. There were already people spending money on black car services, but Uber thought they could offer a better service using mobile connectivity.

### 3. They Want to Build Something Cool ðŸ˜Ž
Finally, some ideas are just "cool."

These startups typically don't think about [their business model](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-business-model) until they have to, so they need to raise a lot of money to get to break even. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all fit into this category. Each built something totally novel at the time, but they weren't solving an existing problem that had real money behind it at first. They later layered a business model on once they had an audience.

The "cool" option is the riskiest, but it gives you a unique opportunity to define a category. That's something not many startups do.

Ultimately though, you shouldn't put too much stock in the first iteration of your idea. Instead, be open to change and pivot often as you move into the next, more important step: validation.

## Validating Your Idea
**TL;DR: Talk is cheap. Getting payment from customers is the best validation.**

Once you have an idea, it's time to see if anyone is willing to pay for it. That's right, before you go off into a cave to build your MVP, take a step back and talk to people.

A few years ago, I was working on a SaaS application that I thought would be a great product. I set up about 20 conversations with prospective customers and out of those twenty calls, just one person was ready to pay for this tool today. I went back to the drawing board, but took what I learned from the prospects who said "Yes" and "No" to rework the offer.

<a href="https://amzn.to/3dliqHf"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wkNuxBh.jpg" style="width: 240px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;" alt="The Mom Test book cover"></a>

Ultimately, I decided that the demand wasn't urgent enough. Existing solutions worked well enough and the few companies that had a big enough problem that my tool might have solved it were building their own solutions in-house. It's possible that after a few more iterations, I might have figured something out, but I decided to move on to other things.

The best book I've found on having these customer validation conversations is _[The Mom Test](https://amzn.to/3dliqHf)_.  In it, Rob Fitzpatrick explains exactly how he gets input that goes _beyond_ the affirming, "That sounds great!" feedback that is so dangerous to entrepreneurs.

### Validation Means Exposing Your Ideas
One problem that first-time founders have with this approach is that they are afraid someone will copy their ideas.

**This is naive. Ideas are worthless and execution is everything.**

That's why I typically [do not recommend "stealth mode"](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/stealth-startup) to startups. If you want your software startup to outlast its runway, you need to validate it _before_ you invest heavily in your product. [Launch early](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/when-to-launch) and iterate often.

### Lean Customer Development: Prototyping and Making Pre-Sales
Two common tactics for validating a startup idea are building a prototype and making pre-sales. After conversations with prospects (which are basically free), these are the next fastest ways to start validating your idea.

You can make prototypes in a tool like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), use a no-code app builder like [Bubble](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/bubble-web-app), or just [set up a simple website](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-website) to show prospects what you plan on building. Add a [Wufoo](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1379130&u=1653894&m=89794) or Google Form (or [another one of these alternatives](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/google-forms-alternatives)), collect a list of potential customers.

Next, show your prototype or no-code app to prospects and see what they think. Decide which feedback is useful and disregard the rest (that's right, you should _not_ listen to all your prospects). Keep your initial feature set lean and focused on the problem you most want to solve first.

For example:

- If you want to build a real-estate comparison website, start by manually collecting home prices in a specific area and limiting prospects to buyers in that city. If people sign up for your manual comparison product, they'll surely sign up for an automated one once you finish it.
- What if you want to create an advanced home automation solution? Instead of spending tons on R&D to build software that controls all of a home's devices, why not start with one thing: automatic timer lights. These are cheap and readily available, and you can install and maintain them for your customers and teach them how to use them. Once you know there is a demand for these lights, you can start to add products to your lineup.

The lean customer development method is almost always better than the product-first method, but the challenge is often figuring out how it applies to your problem and solution. Get creative, research existing tools, and discover the depth of the pain point you're solving.

The more validation you have _before_ you start fundraising, [bringing on a co-founder](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/non-technical-founder-hiring-cto), hiring, and building your app, the more leverage and certainty you will have. This means you'll be able to hold on to more of your equity for longer and you'll get better terms if you decide you ultimately need funding to make your software startup a success.

## Fundraising
**TL;DR: Network like mad. Investors put money into people they trust.**

There's a lot of B.S. on the internet about fundraising. No matter how egalitarian investors want to make you feel like they are, entrepreneurs with investors in their trusted personal network will always have an easier time getting funding.

**If you decide you need to raise money, find a way to meet investors.**

Start with the easy ones: your friends, family, and nearby angel investors. Then, as you get some interest, ask those people for introductions and work your way into personal wealth managers, larger angel groups, and seed-stage VCs.

Software startups typically raise $500,000 - $3,000,000 for their first round of funding, and most venture capitalists (VCs) won't get involved until your Series A round (typically $1,000,000 - $10,000,000).

Keep in mind that taking on investors means giving up equity, preferred stock, and some control of your company. It's a fantastic way to pour fuel on your company's fire, but an investment is not free money and it's not a loan.

### Can You Self-Fund Your Startup?
A pathway that's becoming more popular in slow-growth software startups is "bootstrapping" or self-funding the business. If you skip fundraising, you need to get paying customers as soon as possible or have an existing business that throws off profit already.

You could also leverage existing assets (i.e., mortgage your house or take on credit card debt), but that's a very risky path. If your business fails, you could be personally liable for any debts.

The upside to going this route is that you won't give up equity, and you can control every aspect of the business (within legal bounds). This means that if you ever get the chance to sell your software startup, 100% of the proceeds belong to you, and you can decide whether the sale is a good deal or not.

### Alternative Funding Strategies

Raising money from traditional investors or self-funding are not the only two options for entrepreneurs anymore. Rolling funds, crowdfunding campaigns, and initial coin offerings (ICOs) have all gained prominence in recent years.

[I think this trend will continue](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/2020s#alternative-access-to-funding), but each of these new funding mechanisms seems to have a pretty short half-life. Once the hype wore off, valuations went down and investors (and regulators) have become more skeptical.

But, if you're especially adventurous, maybe it's worth a shot?

### Business Structure
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but I tend to see most funded startups use a C-Corp and most bootstrapped or self-funded startups use an LLC or an S-Corp.

After you decide which structure makes sense based on your proposed funding model and equity split, go to [ZenBusiness to set it up](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1229325&u=1653894&m=81890&urllink=&afftrack=). This is one of those tasks that used to cost you a couple thousand dollars when a lawyer did it for you, and now it's just a few clicks and a few hundred dollars on [ZenBusiness](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1229325&u=1653894&m=81890&urllink=&afftrack=) or LegalZoom.

## Your First Hires
**TL;DR: Hire self-directed, entrepreneurial, ambitious generalists to start. Fill out specific roles as you grow.**

[Working for an early-stage startup](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/working-at-startup) requires a special kind of personality. I've been the first engineer at two tech startups in my career, and while it's a lot of fun, it's also nothing like the corporate jobs I had before that.

Instead of being pigeon-holed into a single piece of the codebase, I was expected to jump around between customer service calls, support requests, QA, writing code, code reviews, deploying code, and project management. It's fun but exhausting, and most employees used to working with big companies will find the pace overwhelming.

I like hiring people with a bit of an entrepreneurial streak. Maybe they've got a couple side projects or used to run an affiliate site? Maybe they ran a club in college? Maybe they took a year off to write a book?

Look for people who might get passed over by big companies, but can work independently and cover a wide range of skills. For example, I've seen crossover roles like customer service + marketing, engineering + support, and sales + account management at startups. Before each job becomes a full-time role, you need people who can flex into a couple slots.

### Be Disciplined in Your Hiring Approach

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0WTo1So.png" style="width: 240px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;" alt="Recruit Rockstars book cover" />](https://amzn.to/3fjDuP4)

The biggest problem I see in startup hiring is a lack of discipline. Many founders trust their guts instead of looking at candidates objectively, so they end up hiring people who are just like them.

Jeff Hyman recommends creating a rubric in his book, _[Recruit Rockstars](https://amzn.to/3fjDuP4)_. [I use this approach](https://draft.dev/learn/posts/hiring-rubric) in my business today and it's been really helpful for minimizing personal bias in my hiring practices.
  
### Minimum Viable Human Resources
Once you start bringing on employees, you become the defacto human resources department. Founders are rarely enthusiastic about this new role, but it's absolutely necessary. The good news is that you don't have to be perfect early on, just start with four basic things: 

- **One-on-ones** - Use these as a time to reconnect with employees and continue sharing the vision.
- **Payroll** - The [software tools available for payroll](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/payroll-software-tools) are infinitely better now than they were a decade ago, so use them.
- **Culture** - It's mostly [defined by the founders](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-culture) early on, but it should not be ignored.
- **Diversity and inclusion** - Don't just pay it lip service. Make this core to your company now so you can attract the top talent, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.

Expect hiring to be much more challenging and time-consuming than you think. Having a consistent process will help, but there's no way to eliminate the human variability inherent in building a business with other people.

## Marketing and Growth
**TL;DR: Get _very_ specific about your target market and find 1-2 channels that work consistently.**

Counterintuitively, the more narrowly you define your target customer, the easier it will be to grow. By defining who your software product is for, you can eliminate wasted effort on those who are not a good fit yet.

Ironically, most startups that dream of becoming the next billion dollar unicorn stuggle with this because they want to prove they're in a huge market. But, when you look at startups that have succeeded, you almost always see a very small go-to-market customer base.

For example, Uber started in one city (San Francisco) and with one kind of car (chauffeured luxury cars). This allowed them to target a very small subclass of people in the Bay Area who they knew they could reach and prevented them from wasting their precious early marketing dollars on the masses.

### You Just Need One Great Channel
The other common marketing pitfall is believing that you need multiple user acquisition channels to help your software startup get off the ground. Not true; you need **one or two good channels** to get started.

For example, when I started Draft.dev last year, I used referrals and my personal social media to build our customer list. We have grown to a team of 50 people on these two channels alone, so rather than get bogged down in adding new channels, we're focused on the two that work today. Once we exhaust them (i.e., growth starts to flatten off), we'll start investing in the next channel.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mqae688.jpg" style="width: 240px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;" alt="Hacking Growth book cover" />](https://amzn.to/3fxAgt5)

There are plenty of options you can try as you get started. Direct outreach via cold email or LinkedIn (for B2B), content marketing, paid advertisements, social media marketing, product-led growth, referrals or affiliate partnerships, open-source marketing - the list is never ending.

My favorite book on growth for software startups is [_Hacking Growth_ by Sean Ellis](https://amzn.to/3fxAgt5). It shares an inside look into the growth strategies that worked for many well-known startups, and while marketing strategies tend to get dated quickly, the specific tactics might help inspire you to try something new.

## Product-Market Fit
- it's a continuum, never finished
- indicators you're starting to find it: people find your product organically (word of mouth), people stick around, you're consistently delivering value profitability, you're growing quickly and doesn't feel like a struggle

## Thinking Like a Manager
- by the time you reach 5-10 employees, your primary job will be management
- need to think like a business owner not executor
- biggest factor limiting startup growth after Product market fit
- let go of control
- books: emyth, built to sell
- roles: hiring, vision, processes, partnerships, big sales, funding

Lean startup demands that you test your product before you build it, and lean customer development essentially takes that imperative to its next logical step: get a customer before you build it. His advice was to spend as much time as possible in the field, asking questions, and getting real pain points from your potential future customers as possible before spending a dime designing, building, or marketing your product. 

It's something that when you hear it makes so much sense, but yet very few entrepreneurs actually do it this way. So often people insist that they need a product to demo before they talk to customers, and by the time they realize they've built something that no one needs, they're discouraged and out of money or time (time being the most precious of the two).

Premature automation and optimization is a huge time suck, and developers are expensive. The last two startups I've been with have used off-the-shelf services to create their MVPs, and even now when we want to test something new at The Graide Network, we usually do it manually or semi-manually before we build software around it. If you have an idea, great! I'd love to see you make it happen, but don't fall into the trap of building something before you know it will sell.
