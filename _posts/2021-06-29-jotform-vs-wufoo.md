Whether you’re starting a business, exploring a new product offering, or simply collecting data from your existing userbase, online forms are an essential part of the internet. When I started my career in software development, you basically had to build forms from scratch if you wanted anything more complicated than a few text fields, but now, [the options for online forms are seemingly endless](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/google-forms-alternatives).

In this article, I’ll take a look at two of the most popular form creation tools available online: [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com/pricing/?utm_source=karll-hughes&utm_campaign=jf1&utm_medium=blog) and [Wufoo](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1379130&u=1653894&m=89794). I’ll try to compare **JotForm vs. Wufoo** in terms of their features, use cases, and similarities.

## The Importance of Online Forms for Businesses

But businesses shouldn’t just slap on web forms on their sites willy-nilly, and they shouldn’t just go with whatever works. Your form’s design is a crucial component. It can help your business land a new lead, or it can cause you to lose a potential customer.

Aside from the design, you also need to consider your form’s placement and delivery. Irrelevant or ill-timed forms can annoy visitors, whereas the form with all the right elements, including timing and context, can help increase a business’s engagement rates.

## Types of Online Forms

Web forms come in different styles, content types, and lengths. There are a number of online forms you can use, depending on your purpose:

### Contact Forms

You might have encountered a sales contact form while browsing a site. This type of form might have a heading along the lines of "Contact our sales team" or “Sales Inquiry.” This will usually have a field that lets visitors leave a question or a comment. Note that this form is different from a *General Inquiry* or a *Contact Us* form.

### Signup Forms

This category encompasses simple signup forms for newsletters and account signup forms for social media or shopping websites.

### Registration

An online registration form, whether for an event or a contest, makes it easier for businesses to monitor their attendees and send event-centered information to the attendees or participants.

### Customer Feedback

Customer feedback forms include website visitor feedback forms and evaluation forms. These are particularly helpful if you’re looking to improve the look of your site or your services.

### Order and Payment

Having an order and payment form on your website is great for immediate sales conversions as it offers a seamless buying process. A form that’s conveniently placed also makes it easier and more convenient for visitors and customers to place an order and pay for it.

In the JotForm vs. Wufoo ** ** debate, we need to look at the key features that both form creation tools have. These include:

Wufoo also has an online form builder that lets you create your desired form with just a few clicks. On the left side of the window, you’ll find a selection of elements that’ll allow you to add fields, customize them accordingly, and set your form settings.

## Final Thoughts

Aside from Google Forms, [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com/pricing/?utm_source=karll-hughes&utm_campaign=jf1&utm_medium=blog), and [Wufoo](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1379130&u=1653894&m=89794), there are a number of [other form creation tools](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/google-forms-alternatives) that you can use. These tools include [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr), [Formidable Forms](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=841990&u=1653894&m=64739), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), and [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/).

All of these tools have their own set of unique features. Some have a simple creation interface and are geared toward non-technical users, while others are aimed at developers. I’ve used many of them successfully, but I think it’s ultimately about picking one and trying it out.
