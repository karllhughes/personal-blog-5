A few weeks ago I wrote a post for Codeship outlining our method for building a [PHP command line application with Docker](https://blog.codeship.com/building-a-php-command-line-app-with-docker/). Today, the second part of this series was published: [Adding CI and CD to a PHP Command Line App With Docker](https://blog.codeship.com/adding-ci-and-cd-to-a-php-command-line-app-with-docker/).

In the tutorial, I'll show you how to use Codeship to build and test your Dockerized PHP application and then deploy it to a server with Docker Compose. I've been continuing to refine this process (I know most people prefer to use a container registry), but for basic purposes this works. Check out the article on [Codeship's blog](https://blog.codeship.com/adding-ci-and-cd-to-a-php-command-line-app-with-docker/) and let me know what you think.
