Two weeks ago I traveled to Atlanta to do the [Publix Georgia Half Marathon](http://www.georgiamarathon.com/), and then this past week I did the [Chitown Half Marathon](https://www.allcommunityevents.com/chi_town_half_marathon/chi_town_half_mar_home.html) along the lake here in Chicago. They were my first two races of the season, so I wasn’t sure what to expect, especially since I’m a bit heavier now than I was at the end of last race season. It looks like I’m still making consistent improvements though.
