Imagine that you are preparing a dinner party, and you break one of your Great Aunt Sally’s 120 year old ceramic cups. You’ve got a set of 7, and 8 guests coming to dinner.  “No worries,” you think, “I’ll just scan one of the others and print a new one before they arrive!”

I spoke with two leading minds in the industry about the potential they see in 3D printing, and the way that it will change the way goods are produced forever.
