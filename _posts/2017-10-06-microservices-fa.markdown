For the past couple years, I've been guest lecturing at several Chicago-area bootcamp programs, and most of the time I've delivered some form of this talk on microservices and software development. While the talk is technical, it's approachable for developers at just about any skill level (or so the Fullstack people have told me).

I have also pitched a version of this talk to several conferences, and written on this topic (for [php[architect] magazine](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/php-architect-9-2017) and [Codeship](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/incremental-development-codeship)) in the past few months. I've done this talk at Fullstack three times this year, and this time, they recorded it for their YouTube channel.
