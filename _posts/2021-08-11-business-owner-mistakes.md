## Question

**What is a common mistake that small-business owners make when their businesses begin growing?**

## Answer

Here are four common mistakes I've seen founders make as their business starts to grow:

### 1. They hire too slowly

Small business owners who are used to stable, small teams don't realize that during periods of explosive growth, they have to hire *ahead* of demand.

So, they get behind and hire too late. New hires always require more time at first, so the owner is now training a new employee *while* the business is growing and they get even further behind.

Clay Mosely [once told me to *hire based on where you want to be, not where you are*](https://millo.co/podcasts/freelancetofounder?id=ccac6848-ac50-11eb-93e1-27c57db84952).

### 2. Their costs rise non-linearly

A lot of founders who are used to doing everything themselves don't realize that more growth means more hiring, which means more costs. Sometimes, a small business's costs may rise non-linearly with growth.

This leads to the next problem...

### 3. They fail to optimize their prices

When a small business starts to grow unexpectedly, it might be a sign that prices are *too low or too high*.

If greater demand increases overhead, entrepreneurs need to [raise prices accordingly](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/entrepreneur-salary#raise-prices).

Conversely, if greater demand helps you get lower costs, you might want to lower prices to outsell competitors who see your growth as a golden opportunity.

### 4. They don't figure out *why* the growth happened

Finally, small business owners who hit an inflection point of serious growth should figure out *why* this growth suddenly happened. Uncontrolled growth is scary because it could go away tomorrow, but well-understood and controlled growth is how you build a sustainable, scalable business.
