For the last couple years I've had a lot of success using Docker in my test environment. While I think the tool has a lot of potential for production too, it's easiest to get started with local and continuous integration systems.

Last week I published a guest article on Codeship's blog outlining 7 ways that you can get started using Docker to improve your test suite. While the examples are in PHP and Node, the principles should work for any language.

If you want more Docker tutorials and info, check out [my other blog, Shiphp](https://www.shiphp.com/) where I write about Docker and PHP.
