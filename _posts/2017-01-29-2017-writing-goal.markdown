---
I've tried to write *something* every week for the past few years, but I'm not 100% consistent. It usually comes in waves where I spend a week or two cranking out several articles and then maybe a month without much output, but I'm going to up my consistency and hopefully volume in 2017.

## My goal for 2017: Publish something every day.

Most days won't be long, detailed posts, but I'm making it my mission to write and publish at least one piece of content every day. I've got a long backlog of blog post ideas, I've been writing news commentary on Medium, and I'm about to start editing and republishing old blog content as well.

I hope to do a few things during this year while focusing on shorter, daily writing. First, I'd like to build the habit of writing every day. I have found that if I do something every day - run, write code, read the news, publish a blog post - I'm more invested in it and I tend to get better at it as well.

Second, I'm hoping to push myself outside of my typical topic range. By writing and publishing something every day, I'll need to come up with new ideas in order to keep myself from getting bored. I'd like to try doing some creative fiction and personal writing in addition to my usual tech op/ed style.

Finally, I would like to improve myself. I feel that writing is one of the most valuable skills a technical leader can possess, and you don't have to be professionally trained for years to do it. I don't consider myself an especially skilled writer, but I enjoy it, and I want to get better by doing it every day.

## My 2017 publishing calendar
I'm going to record everything I publish in 2017 here. I will probably only update the list once per month or so, but I'm hoping that by the end of the year I'll have a nice collection of varied writing in this list.

#### January
In January, I did a daily news journal on [my Medium account](https://medium.com/@karllhughes). Each article is a summary of one big story I read or the compilation of trends that I've noticed.

#### February
This month, I edited and republishing one old article from my blog every day. I've been writing here for over five years, so many of the older pieces have gotten a bit stale or the formatting has degraded as I've switched blogging platforms. Most of the updates I'm making are minor edits, but a few articles got some significant additions.

#### March
In March I spent my daily writing time working on my open source book, [CTO Patterns](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns). The goal of the project is to define a set of patterns that startup and small company CTOs can use to help them be more successful.

During the course of the month I worked on the following chapters:

- [What is a CTO?](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns/blob/master/1-personal-efficiency/1-what-is-cto.md)
- [Defining Success](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns/blob/master/1-personal-efficiency/2-defining-success.md)
- [Dealing with Fear and Uncertainty](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns/blob/master/1-personal-efficiency/4-fear.md)
- [Striking a Balance](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns/blob/master/1-personal-efficiency/5-balance.md)
- [Networking](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns/blob/master/1-personal-efficiency/6-networking.md)
- [Agile in a Nutshell](https://github.com/karllhughes/cto-patterns/blob/master/2-product-development/1-agile.md)

I also republished a couple posts here on my blog:

- [Health as a Long-Term Investment in Your Success](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/health-investment-success)
