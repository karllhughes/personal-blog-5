I started programming because I loved writing.

In college, I created a campus blog with around 30 of my peers. As a business, the venture was terrible, but it forced me to learn Wordpress and basic web development.

10 years later, [I left my job as a startup CTO to become a full-time writer and business owner](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer).

Check out some of my writing samples below, and if you're looking for help with your blog, [check out my company, Draft.dev](https://draft.dev).

### The PHP and Docker Book
In 2017, I wrote a book called **[Building Your First PHP Application with Docker](https://leanpub.com/first-php-docker-application)** which has since been downloaded by over 1000 developers.

### Comprehensive Guides
One format that I've seen work really well is the long, in-depth guide to a niche topic. I've written
a few of these:

- [CFP Land's 17,000 word guide to Speaking at Tech Conferences](https://www.cfpland.com/guides/speaking/)
- [The Complete Guide for Building APIs Without Code](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-development)
- [The Guide for Building Webs Apps Without Code](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/web-applications)
- [Using Technology to Improve Student Writing Skills](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/using-technology-to-improve-student-writing-skills)

### Tutorials
As an experienced software engineer, I really enjoy sharing my knowledge, so I've written many tutorials for 
sites as a volunteer and paid contributor:

### Software Tool Comparisons
Stackshare invited me to write a couple comparisons between popular technology tools. This was a really fun and unique format, 
so I'd like to find a good place to contribute more of these:

- [Bitbucket vs GitHub vs GitLab](https://stackshare.io/stackups/bitbucket-vs-github-vs-gitlab) (Stackshare)
- [Docker vs Vagrant](https://stackshare.io/stackups/docker-vs-vagrant-cloud) (Stackshare)

### Roundups
I know listacles can be a little clickbaity, but they are fun to write, and can do 
well in search engine rankings.

### Thought Leadership
I always enjoy writing about processes and patterns that I'm seeing in the world of software engineering. These kinds of
posts have a therapeutic quality to me, and they are often among the most widely shared on social media.
