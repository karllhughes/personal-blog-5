I actually started programming because I loved writing.

In college, I started a campus blog with around 30 of my peers. As a business, the venture was terrible, but 
it forced me to learn Wordpress and basic web development.

Now 10 years later, I've written almost as much prose as I have code. In addition to the almost 200 posts
here on this blog, I've been able to contribute to and start a number of professional writing ventures:

### KarlLHughes.com
I can't pick favorites, so here are the top 8 most popular posts I've written in the past 4 years:

### The Guide to Speaking at Technology Conferences

In 2018, I started [speaking at conferences](/speaking/), which led me to start the weekly [CFP Land newsletter](https://www.cfpland.com).

I have now interviewed over 40 technology conference speakers for the [CFP Land blog](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/) now, and I compiled their advice into
**[a 17,000 word guide to speaking at tech conferences](https://www.cfpland.com/guides/speaking/)**. It's available for free, and I try to keep it updated
as I refine my thoughts on public speaking and learn from others.

### The PHP and Docker Book + Shiphp
In 2017, I wrote a book called **[Building Your First PHP Application with Docker](https://leanpub.com/first-php-docker-application)** which has since been downloaded by over 1000 developers.

I also maintain a blog for PHP developers at [Shiphp.com](https://www.shiphp.com/).

### Portable CTO Guides
For a time in 2018/2019, I wrote some [guides for non-technical founders on Portable CTO](https://www.portablecto.com/).
I don't plan to add more of these anytime soon, but these ones are pretty good:

- [The Complete Guide for Building APIs Without Code](https://www.portablecto.com/guides/api-development)
- [The Guide for Building Webs Apps Without Code](https://www.portablecto.com/guides/web-applications)
