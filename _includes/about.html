<section class="about">
  <p>Hi, my name is Karl.</p>
  <p>
    I <a href="/writing/" class="underline">write</a>, <a href="/speaking/" class="underline">speak</a>, and
    <a href="/work/" class="underline">help build startups</a>.
    After 8 years as a CTO in Chicago, I founded
    <strong><a href="https://draft.dev">Draft.dev</a></strong> to help companies create
    high-quality technical content designed to reach software developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the side, I run <strong><a href="https://www.cfpland.com">CFP Land</a></strong>, an email newsletter
    that goes out to almost 2,000 conference speakers every week. 
    I also create marketing courses with my friend, Manuel Weiss on [thisisgoodmarketing.com](https://thisisgoodmarketing.com/).
