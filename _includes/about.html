    Currently, I'm the <strong>Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/" target="_blank">The Graide Network</a></strong>

    I also run <strong><a href="https://www.cfpland.com">CFP Land</a></strong>, where I've built a newsletter that goes
    out to 2,000+ technology conference speakers every week.

    If you like this blog, I send out a regular newsletter for startup founders and employees called
    <strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups">The Portable CTO</a></strong>.
    Every week, I include a handful of tips, tools, and advice that I discover as well as anything new I've written across the internet.
